= DEPRECATED =

hard code create file "this many clients total"
hard code local dropbox repo. possibly in a YAML file...

take real values

= notes =

NB that I don't think XXX has ability to "add from it from anywhere" or possibly keep vanilla copies around...

= someday =

auto...submit them to youtube, too?

auto compress videos (lossless I guess)

Maybe auto compress submissions...zip them right up?

git-annex?

this could be more cost effective than other options, using amazon's freeze...

compress, dedupe

differential backups for large changing files [?]
  differential backup at all? :)
  
look at competitors for ideas

ask people what they want

allow for removable media

business option: "or backup to cloud"
  amazon frozen :)
  they pay, or have their own
  or their own normal amazon?
  or charge per use?

status, etc.

more "realtime" synchro...

instead of waiting for lock, clients provide a "copy your file lock acknowledged" :)
  this is more 'realtime'

fancy shmancy GUI 'recover this from here'

can right click on arbitrary directories "backup track this folder"

can limit cpu/bandwidth usage

use the client done touch files more/better

add a file list/md5's so it can double check...
  at least a "file sum" in the you can go for it...

split too large of files

encryption?

allow "your brother to also sync your stuff" (hmm...just use the public part of it?
  require "shared" dropbox folder, with your brother? yeah that sounds sane...
    does google drive sharing allow them to sync to a local folder at that point? dropbox?

able to use "just the remote API" to copy it to the temp folder, instead of having to have it installed locally [?]

try it with icloud, too, why not?

release an OS X client? :)

pick a new name
  "fake real" website
  distributable

can use gdrive + dropbox at the same time :)

lossless hard core h264 on their way in [?]
  as an option :P

accomodate ftp

accomodate files bigger than the transfer storage [gah]

zip files [?]

update/synchronize "this many clients total" file
