= Yes do =

GUI adjust option "there will be this many clients total"
  GUI local dropbox repo root
  everything else
  save local file, done

test it between 2 computers at work
  
= maybe =

it should transfer empty directories

innosetup
  "daemonize" mode vs. setup
  
auto 7zip
  any single files
  optionally if they just have non jpg?
  what's the best compression method here?

pick a new name
  "fake real" website
  distributable
  
= someday =

warn if it appears it will plow something

use registry to "auto determine" your gdrive home, etc.

  tell them

add a file list/md5's so it can double check the transfer succeeded...

auto compress videos (lossless for now)
  does it help? does it work?

keep a large YAML file of all files...
  maybe on every client [?]

it can "upload to a new candidate" that is added

split too large of files

auto...submit them to youtube, too?

can limit cpu/bandwidth usage

encryption?
  no

allow "your brother to also sync your stuff" (hmm...just use the public part of it?

    does google drive sharing allow them to sync to a local folder at that point? dropbox?

able to use "just the remote API" to copy it to the temp folder, instead of having to have it installed locally [?]

try it with icloud, too, why not?
