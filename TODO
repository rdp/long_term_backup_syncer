= Yes do =

test it between 2 computers at work
  
= maybe =

= someday =

GUI statuses better/at all...

some ability to like "let uncle jim upload you a big folder somehow" that you will preserve in your system  

new icons

prompt to cleanup old transfer "do you still want to transfer them?"

make the long dir name less confusing

it should be able to capture to 2 places, same computer

it "should be locked by somebody else" if there's a transfer request

innosetup

pick a new name
  "fake real" website
  distributable

combine the gdrive folders into subfolders

assert they "have" 3G they can use to give to gdrive...

"this many are currently online"
  "each is doing this..."

  warn on old lock files?
  delete them for current host when I come up?
  
warn on too many files "you should really be zipping this, buddy!"

"daemonize" mode icon vs. setup

auto empty gdrive trash [etc?]
  
cleanup shutdown code it raises an exception?

better folders, don't re-mkdir them if they don't exist

prompt for "gdrive found ok?" for init

gui show status updates, also warn when one client appears to be lagging

work with disconnected storage somehow...

auto 7zip
  any single files
  optionally if they just have non jpg?
  what's the best compression method here?

it should warn on transfer empty directories?

it should capture names of each capture point, make them editable, share the sum number, etc.

it should have one way of allowing "public sync" (like anonymous?)

use some type of system binding to "be notified" when new files appear

warn if it appears it will eventually plow something

use registry to "auto determine" your gdrive home, etc.

NB that I don't think XXX has ability to "add from it from anywhere" or possibly keep vanilla copies around...
  tell them

add a file list/md5's so it can double check the transfer succeeded...

auto compress videos (lossless for now)
  does it help? does it work?

keep a large YAML file of all files...
  maybe on every client [?]

it can "upload to a new candidate" that is added

split too large of files

auto...submit them to youtube, too?

auto upload photos to facebook, too?

git-annex?

create a youtube upload "of images one per frame" as an image backup :)

optionally "if it's bigger than x, then create new..."

this could be more cost effective than other options, using amazon's freeze...

compress, dedupe...blocks?

  differential backup at all? :)
  no
  
look at competitors for ideas

business option: "or backup to cloud"
  amazon frozen :)
  they pay, or have their own
  or their own normal amazon?
  or charge per use?

more "realtime" synchro...

instead of waiting for lock, clients provide a "copy your file lock acknowledged" :)
  this is more 'realtime'

fancy shmancy GUI 'recover this from here'

can right click on arbitrary directories "backup track this folder"

can limit cpu/bandwidth usage

encryption?
  optional 

allow "your brother to also sync your stuff" (hmm...just use the public part of it?
  require "shared" dropbox folder, with your brother? yeah that sounds sane...
    does gdrive sharing allow them to sync to a local folder at that point? dropbox?

able to use "just the remote API" to copy it to the temp folder, instead of having to have it installed locally [?]

try it with icloud, too, why not?

release an OS X client? :)

can use gdrive + dropbox at the same time :)

accomodate ftp

daemonizable..
  has icons at all LOL.

"client x has z files"
