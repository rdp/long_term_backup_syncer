auto 7zip
  any single files
  optionally if they just have non jpg?
  what's the best compression method here?

it should warn on transfer empty directories?

it should capture names of each capture point, make them editable, share the sum number, etc.

it should have one way of allowing "public sync" (like anonymous?)

use some type of system binding to "be notified" when new files appear

is it too taxing to sum the file sizes as they're coming in?

warn if it appears it will plow something

  tell them

add a file list/md5's so it can double check the transfer succeeded...

can limit cpu/bandwidth usage

encryption?
  no

allow "your brother to also sync your stuff" (hmm...just use the public part of it?
