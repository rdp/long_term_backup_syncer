Today:

either copy a full repo worth to a HD (portable?) then copy it to the new repo, or attach the new repo to
a computer with the full repo and copy it over (or via network share).
Then edit the configs of all computers to increment the number.
Then you're good to go.

or you could edit the configs "everywhere" and...then on one location, copy the entire contents of the
long term repo to the "to transfer" side, then it would basically resync *everybody* including the new
guy...
